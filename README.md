# Pentadeep(TM) website build

## About

Pentadeep is a design agency focused on helping businesses across Africa increase their value through improving customer/user satisfaction and increasing loyalty.  

## My Role

I handled the design and development of the website. I used miro for organizing my thougths, xd for creating the visual designs and interaction design, and wrote the HTML, CSS and JavaScript in VScode.
